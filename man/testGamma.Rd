\title{Apply Goodness of Fit Test for Gamma Distribution}
\usage{
testGamma(
  x,
  ngrid = length(x),
  gridpit = FALSE,
  hessian = FALSE,
  rate = TRUE,
  method = "cvm"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a non-empty numeric vector of sample data.}

\item{ngrid}{the number of equally spaced points to discretize the (0,1) interval for computing the covariance function.}

\item{gridpit}{logical. If \code{TRUE} (the default value), the parameter ngrid is ignored and (0,1) interval is divided
based on probability inverse transformed values obtained from the sample. If \code{FALSE}, the interval is divided into ngrid
equally spaced points for computing the covariance function.}

\item{hessian}{logical. If \code{TRUE} the Fisher information matrix is estimated by the observed Hessian Matrix based on
the sample. If \code{FALSE} (the default value) the Fisher information matrix is estimated by the variance of the
observed score matrix.}

\item{rate}{logical. If \code{TRUE} (the default value), the rate is estimated in Gamma distribution. If \code{FALSE}, scale
is estimated. See \code{\link{GammaDist}} for more details.}

\item{method}{a character string indicating which goodness-of-fit statistic is to be computed. The default value is
'cvm' for the Cramer-von-Mises statistic. Other options include 'ad' for the Anderson-Darling statistic, and 'both'
to compute both cvm and ad.}
}
\value{
A list of two containing the following components:
\itemize{
\item Statistic: the value of goodness-of-fit statistic.
\item pvalue: the approximate pvalue for the goodness-of-fit test based on empirical distribution function.
if method = 'cvm' or method = 'ad', it returns a numeric value for the statistic and pvalue. If method = 'both', it
returns a numeric vector with two elements and one for each statistic.
}
}
\description{
Performs the goodness-of-fit test based on empirical distribution function to check if an i.i.d sample
follows a Gamma distribution.
