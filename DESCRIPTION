Description: Routines that allow the user to run goodness of fit tests based on empirical distribution functions for formal model evaluation in a general likelihood model. In addition, functions are provided to test a sample against Normal or Gamma distributions, validate the normality assumptions in a linear model, and examine the appropriateness of a Gamma distribution in generalized linear models with various link functions.
